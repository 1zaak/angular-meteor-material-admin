# Admin web app using Angular-Meteor-Material
This project was designed as the backend administration for the [Ecogiv](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ruizon.ecogivseller) app. It is also heavily inspired by the [Socially](http://www.angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular1/bootstrapping) app by [@urigo](https://github.com/Urigo).

## Design

## Why you need it
This can be used as a Mongo backend and you wanted a way to separate your server application from the admin functions while also not be as fully-featured as a Mongo GUI backend e.g. RoboMongo, etc, in other words, an admin for the non-technical users.

## What's in the box

Basically everything in the [Socially](http://www.angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular1/bootstrapping) app, i.e. Drag-&-Drop image feature, reactive sorting, pagination and search.
